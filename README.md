# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once done, evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

- **Deliverable 1:** Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- **Deliverable 2:** Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- **Deliverable 3:** Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- **Deliverable 4:** A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis

## Results
- Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
